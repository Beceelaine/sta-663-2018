    "With massive data, we need to load, extract, transform and analyze the data on multiple computers to overcome I/O and processing bottlenecks. However, when working on multiple computers (possibly hundreds to thousands), there is a high risk of failure in one or more nodes. Distributed computing frameworks are designed to handle failures gracefully, allowing the developer to focus on algorithm development rather than system administration.\n",

    "The first such widely used open source framework was the Hadoop MapReduce framework. This provided transparent fault tolerance, and popularized the functional programming approach to distributed computing. The Hadoop work-flow uses repeated invocations of the following instructions:\n",

    "\n",
    "- the repeated saving and loading of data to disk can be slow, and makes interactive development very challenging\n",
    "- restriction to only `map` and `reduce` constructs results in increased code complexity, since every problem must be tailored to the `map-reduce` format\n",
    "\n",
    "Spark is a more recent framework for distributed computing that addresses the limitations of Hadoop by allowing the use of in-memory datasets for iterative computation, and providing a rich set of functional programming constructs to make the developer's job easier. Spark also provides libraries for common big data tasks, such as the need to run SQL queries, perform machine learning and process large graphical structures."
